rules while making functional component?
1=> naming convention  of functional component should be as follows
        => name of component should followed by a capital letter ex:=== function Fun(){} 
        => filename should be same as your component name. ex=> Fun.js

2=> while writing html in react component you have to make sure they are inclosed in a parent tag or you can use react fragment (<></>).
3=> only single component should be made in single file.

how do we import and export in react?
export => export default component_name;
import => import component_name from "component_path"
example;= import Header from "./component/Header";

how do we do basic styling?
1=> className
2=> the css file will be imported in app.js because other than app.js every other component which we will make will be rendered in app.js.


why we do not use class instead of className in JSX of react?
=> JSX is extension of Javascript and class is a reserved keyword in JS ,so to avoid clashing or error 
of naming during complilation of JSX we use className.
